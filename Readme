The committees, comments, variables, function are written in English. I'm trying to study swift and english at the same time. Sorry if the translation or agreement is incorrect.

M2 Challenge Project, replicating the detail screen layout of the movies from the TodoMovies4 app.

I can't say which 'design pattern' I'm using specifically, but I consulted with an analyst in the area and he informed that the one I'm using would be a more organized pattern and used in companies, the app is more organized.

To run the application you must have installed cocoapods and alamofire 5.4. Used version of xcode (Version 13.1 (13A1030d)).

Branch where the final project is located: M2dev2

If, when running the app, the movie image does not load, just run the project again and it will load. I couldn't let the alamofire async, due to the time to deliver the challenge. The project also has no treatment in case of offline tests (without internt).

I used JSON for most of the project https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=8f04577aff690de3a89bef5e5f666fe5&language=en-US. I performed tests by changing the movie id, it works correctly.

I couldn't check the movie screen effect as the todomovie4 app only installed on iphone. I didn't get an elongated iPhone to test, but consulting the internet, analysts in the area, I was informed about the gradient effect, which I tried to reproduce.

I didn't understand what 'RX' would be, I searched, but I didn't find information.
