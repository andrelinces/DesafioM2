M2 Challenge Project, replicating the detail screen layout of the movies from the TodoMovies4 app.
The committees, comments, variables, function are written in English. I'm trying to study swift and english at the same time. Sorry if the translation or agreement is incorrect.
To run the application you must have installed cocoapods and alamofire 5.4. Used version of xcode (Version 13.1 (13A1030d)).
I used JSON for most of the project https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=8f04577aff690de3a89bef5e5f666fe5&language=en-US. I performed tests by changing the movie id, it works correctly.
